## Development

The frontend is a React app. It is automatically deployed to [hatey.monster](https://hatey.monster) when a new commit is pushed to the `main` branch.
The deployment is done by GitHub Actions and can be found in the [deploy.yml](.github/workflows/deploy.yml) file.

The swagger documentation is automatically generated by the backend and can be found at [api.hatey.monster](https://api.hatey.monster).

### Setup

```bash
git clone git@github.com:pandermatt/hatey-bot-frontend.git
cd hatey-bot-frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### Run

```bash
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### Build

```bash
npm run build
```

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
